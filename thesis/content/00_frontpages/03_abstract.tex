An important key aspect of study, work and life at a university is its physical campus paired together with an extensive and sophisticated user experience for its related digital resources. 
Being one of the biggest continuous campuses in Europe, Technische Universit√§t (TU) Berlin's main campus in Charlottenburg often challenges its students and teachers with a lack of capabilities for orientation and localization. It is furthermore home to an overwhelming and complex digital information culture, which comes distributed over a variety of different online platforms.

This thesis portrays the development of a campus app for mobile devices, that implements a digital campus map for orientation and navigation purposes as well as an overlaying information layer for improvement of usability aspects related to TU Berlin's web resources. This solution is furthermore compared to the most popular navigation apps for mobile devices and outperforms both established solutions in terms of campus resolution by factor 2 (Google Maps) / factor 5 (Apple Maps) and quality of suggested routes for navigation on campus with time savings of 30\% (Google Maps, Apple Maps) and distance savings of 23\% (Google Maps) and 20\% (Apple Maps).
